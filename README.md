### Technology

Our team contains six students and I'm responsible for all front-end works and back-end works during three days' competitions.

Out system have three important parts in total:

- Front-end: a modified version of [AMiner](https://www.aminer.cn)
- Back-end: Django framework
- Database: MySQL

Because time was life during a short-term competition and my team was in lack of front-end developers, I didn't use Bootstrap or Vue.js. Instead I just referred to asome famous website and modifyied their html and css.

For back-end server, I'm good at flask\Django\PHP. Finally I choose to django just because of it's efficient development capability. Another reason is that my teammates didn't know PHP and most of them only specialized in Python.

MySQL is enough for our work and it's convenient.
